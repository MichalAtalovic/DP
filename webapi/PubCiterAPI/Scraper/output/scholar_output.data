Within the described project, a complex quality assurance method, based on a model for quality assessment of e-learning – ELQ, has been proposed and verified. A modified Kirkpatrick Evaluating Four Level Model has been used for evaluation of quality of blended learning. After implementation of described models, experimental data has been collected and analyzed.

As knowledge becomes crucial factor of society success–we speak about knowledge-based society–the place and role of universities is changing, as well. In order to stay the crucial source and mediator of knowledge in new society, universities have to adapt onto process of society character change. It appears that not only content but also form must be changed. Innovation cycle has been so shortened that traditional methods of education fail to satisfy constantly growing requirements. Existing technology enable us to change the fundamentals of education and thereby the essence of universities, as well. On the ground of these facts, management of the Faculty of Education of TU accepted the strategic program of elearning services in 2001 year. In this program main accent is put on the valuation of own expert knowledge transformed into valuable content and interesting and suitable form of courses. University management accepted this program as pilot for the whole university. External and internal factors of university change are described in this paper. Moreover, scope and nature of changes, as well as conditions, that have to be fulfilled in order to be changes successful, are described in paper.

The continually changing objectives place increasing emphasis on the clear formulation and use of decision techniques supported by computers. Computers have been used for design, manufacturing, control, diagnosis and monitoring in manufacturing industries. This allowed us to implement more advanced manufacturing ideas. The technological advances in manufacturing have also addressed the research interests of intelligence systems for planning, operation, control and diagnosis of manufacturing. In the world of manufacturing there is a number of processes in which a decision has to be made. First, operation research (OR) techniques have been widely used to support decision making in industrial production. However, difficulties have been encountered with the formulation of models, management of data, and interpretation of results. Since many problems of manufacturing systems are usually unstructured or ill-structured problems that deal with nonnumerical or non-algorithmic information, new methods had to be searched for.

Next an application of this procedure is presented as an experimental comparison of two control strategies that have been simulated by the SIMFACTORY II. 5. simulation tool. Experiments have been carried out in an interactive manner to improve the parameters of control strategies. The simulation results reveal the ratio of a control strategy improvement."}, "citations": [], "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mtf.stuba.sk/buxus/docs/doc/veda_a_vyskum/monografie/VM-Vazan.pdf#page=34", "eprint_url": "https://www.mtf.stuba.sk/buxus/docs/doc/veda_a_vyskum/monografie/VM-Vazan.pdf#page=34", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"bib": {"title": "VALIDITY OF DURING-TERM E-ASSESSMENT", "author": "M MISUT and M MISUTOVA", "abstract": "Presented research study deals with validity of e-assessment of students during-term in the university introductory Mathematics course. During-term e-assessment is conducted to make judgments as to whether students have achieved the learning outcomes of the particular course stage and for the purposes of grading and further progression in course, as well. Results of assessment are used by students for further learning path (formative use) as well as for calculating final course grade (summative use), therefore, during-term assessment has to provide valid information for both students and teachers.To check the validity of e-assessment, experiment was performed such that assessment results were compared with performance scores using the same conditions in test and retest. Those students (153 from 404 students), which obtained low performance score, re-took the during-term test after six weeks to determine if they could improve their scores. Performance scores were found not to differ depending on whether the assessment was completed in the first run or the re–run mode. Surprisingly, the mean performance scores in five from six topics covered by test were slightly lower in retest than in test. These findings provide support for the validity of proposed e-assessment method. Future studies could help to determine the extent to which this finding can be generalized beyond the assessment procedures and the type of sample used in this experiment."}, "citations": [], "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin_Misut/publication/315353444_VALIDITY_OF_DURING-TERM_E-_ASSESSMENT/links/593ad6f1458515e398b423d3/VALIDITY-OF-DURING-TERM-E-ASSESSMENT.pdf", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin_Misut/publication/315353444_VALIDITY_OF_DURING-TERM_E-_ASSESSMENT/links/593ad6f1458515e398b423d3/VALIDITY-OF-DURING-TERM-E-ASSESSMENT.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"bib": {"title": "Postavenie elektronického vzdelávania na TU v Trnave", "author": "V GAZDÍKOVÁ and M MIŠÚT and K ŠKOLKOVÁ and V GABAĽOVÁ", "journal": "Sborník příspěvků z mezinárodní konference e-Learning ve vysokoškolském vzdělávání 2004", "pages": "50-54"}, "citations": [], "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3213694001943491838&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "eprint_url": "", "cites_per_year": {}}]}
