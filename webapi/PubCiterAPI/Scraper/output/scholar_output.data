This paper describes selected aspects of the implementation model, which aims at the improvement and complex assurance of quality and cost efficiency in the context of e-learning. Within the described project, a complex quality assurance method, based on a model for quality assessment of e-learning – ELQ, has been proposed and verified. A modified Kirkpatrick Evaluating Four Level Model has been used for evaluation of quality of blended learning. After implementation of described models, experimental data has been collected and analyzed. These will drive the direction for future improvements."}, "citations": [{"title": "Survey of quality models of e-learning systems", "author": ["V Nikolić", "J Kaljevic", "S Jović", "D Petković"], "pub_year": "2018", "venue": "Physica A: Statistical …", "abstract": "The main aim of the survey was to present current state of quality models of e-learning systems.
